>> NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index): A remote sensing index designed to enhance the visibility of open water features in satellite or aerial imagery. It is typically calculated from the Green and Near-Infrared (NIR) spectral bands using the formula (Green - NIR) / (Green + NIR).

When citing NDWI, it's important to be clear which formulation you are using, but the McFeeters (1996) paper is generally considered the foundational reference for the index specifically designed and named for delineating open water bodies [@McFeeters1996]. 

For Vegetation Liquid Water Content (using NIR and SWIR bands):
This index was also proposed in 1996, sometimes referred to as NDWI but often preferably called the Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) or LSWI (Land Surface Water Index) to avoid confusion with McFeeters' index. It's more sensitive to water content in vegetation canopy and soil moisture [@Gao1996].
