# Allometric Equation


>> An allometric equation is a mathematical formula describing how different physical characteristics of trees or forests relate to each other, usually based on measurable attributes like height, diameter, and volume.

## Description

Allometric equations typically assume proportional relationships—often expressed as power-law equations e.g., 

$$
𝑦
=
𝑎
𝑥
𝑏
y=ax 
b
$$

where one attribute (e.g., tree volume) is estimated from another, easily measured attribute (e.g., tree diameter).

For instance:

Predicting a tree’s volume from its diameter.

Estimating a stand’s biomass from average height or basal area.

## Notes

This concept is applied to forest metrics in Yang 2021[@Yang2021]
