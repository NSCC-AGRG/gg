>> A digital representation of the bare-earth ground surface topography (elevation), commonly stored as a raster grid where each cell value corresponds to the elevation of that location. DEMs are fundamental geospatial datasets used for terrain analysis, hydrological modeling, and visualization, often derived from sources like lidar or photogrammetry. They are distinct from Digital Surface Models (DSMs), which include the heights of buildings and vegetation.
