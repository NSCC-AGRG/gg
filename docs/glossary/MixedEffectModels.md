# Mixed Effect Models

>> Mixed effect models are statistical models that include both fixed effects (parameters shared across all data, like treatment effects) and random effects (parameters that vary across groups or subjects, like individual differences). They're used when data has hierarchical or grouped structure, allowing for more accurate modeling of variation at multiple levels.
