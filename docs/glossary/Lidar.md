>> A remote sensing technology that measures distances by illuminating a target with pulses of laser light and timing the return of the reflected signals. This process generates a dense collection of precise three-dimensional points (a point cloud), commonly used (often from airborne or terrestrial platforms) to create highly accurate digital elevation models (DEMs/DSMs), map vegetation structure, and model terrain, buildings, and infrastructure.
