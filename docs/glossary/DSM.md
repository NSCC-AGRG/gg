>> A digital representation of the Earth's surface elevation that includes the tops of buildings, vegetation canopy, infrastructure, and other features situated on the ground. Typically stored as a raster grid, DSMs capture the elevation of the highest surfaces encountered by remote sensing systems (like lidar or photogrammetry). Unlike a DEM (Digital Elevation Model), which models the bare-earth ground level, the DSM explicitly includes the heights of above-ground objects.
