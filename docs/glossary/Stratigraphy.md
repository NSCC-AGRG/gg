>> Stratigraphy is the geological discipline that studies the arrangement, layering, and relationships of rock strata, primarily to interpret Earth's history. It involves analyzing sedimentary rock layers (strata) to understand their chronological sequence, age, composition, and formation processes, enabling the reconstruction of geological timelines and past environmental conditions.
