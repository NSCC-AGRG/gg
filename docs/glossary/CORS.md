>>A permanently installed Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver operating 24/7 at a precisely determined location, tied to a specific geodetic datum (like NAD83). CORS stations, often part of coordinated networks (such as Natural Resources Canada's CACS - Canadian Active Control System), continuously stream or archive high-accuracy satellite observation data. This data serves as a reference, enabling users like surveyors and mappers to significantly improve the precision of their own GNSS positioning measurements through post-processing or real-time correction techniques.
