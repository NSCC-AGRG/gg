# AGRG
## Applied Geomatics Research Group

Applied Geomatics Research Group (AGRG), located at the Annapolis Valley Campus, has over 20 years of coastal mapping research experience. Using high-resolution remote sensing, such as topo-bathymetric lidar, combined with geographic information system (GIS) techniques, AGRG maps, monitors and models coastal zones with an emphasis on flood risk, erosion and habitat mapping.

Led by Dr. Tim Webster, AGRG applies advanced mapping techniques to solve problems and support sustainable development in the coastal zone and aquaculture sites, including flood risk associated with storm surges and sea level rise and modelling contaminants in the coastal zone.

AGRG also conducts watershed and hydrological studies of inland river systems. Watershed and river hydrology benefit from their high-resolution elevation mapping capabilities, both on land and below the water.
