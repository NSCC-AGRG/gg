# Point Clouds

>> A point cloud is a collection of spatial data points defined in a 3D coordinate system, typically representing the external surface of objects or terrain. Each point has an X, Y, Z coordinate and may also include attributes such as intensity, color, return number, classification, or time. Point clouds are commonly generated using Lidar, photogrammetry, or 3D scanners and are used in applications such as mapping, modeling, forestry, engineering, and autonomous navigation.
