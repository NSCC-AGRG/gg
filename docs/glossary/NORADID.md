# NORAD ID

>> A NORAD ID is a unique identifier assigned by the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) to track objects in Earth's orbit, including satellites and space debris. It is used globally for cataloging space objects and is typically a five-digit number associated with a specific launch.
