## Earth Observation Data Management System

>> The Earth Obervation Data Management System (EODMS) is the Government of Canada's archive and access system for federal Earth observation images including air photos and satellite imagery. The system is operated by Canada Centre for Mapping and Earth Observation (CCMEO) under Natural Resources Canada (NRCan). Open data (e.g. Sentinel, RADARSAT) is also mirrored on the AWS Open Dataset Registry as well as GEO.ca.

You can access the main web tool here:

Mostly this seems like a place to get RADARSAT and some Airphotos.
