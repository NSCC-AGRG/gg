>> A mathematically defined, three-dimensional surface created by rotating an ellipse around its minor axis. In geodesy and mapping, it serves as a simplified approximation of the Earth's shape (which is slightly flattened at the poles). This smooth surface acts as the reference for horizontal datums (e.g., NAD83, WGS84) upon which latitude, longitude, and ellipsoidal height coordinates are computed.
