>> Google Earth Engine (GEE): A cloud-based platform developed by Google for planetary-scale geospatial analysis. It combines a multi-petabyte catalog of satellite imagery, climate data, and other geospatial datasets with powerful cloud computing resources and APIs (primarily JavaScript and Python), enabling users to analyze large datasets for environmental monitoring, land cover change detection, climate science, and other Earth observation applications without needing local downloads.
