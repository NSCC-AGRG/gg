## Ecological Land Classification

>> An ecological classification framework.

The Ecological Land Classification (ELC) is a formal system used by, for example, the Nova Scotia government to classify geographical areas based on various geological, climatic, and biological characteristics. 

You can download the provincial ELC guide (pdf) and boundary layers (shp etc.) from the following link: [https://novascotia.ca/natr/forestry/ecological/ecolandclass.asp]()
