## Normalized Digital Vegegation Index


>>NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index): A remote sensing index designed to quantify the density and health of green vegetation in satellite or aerial imagery. It is calculated from the Red (Visible) and Near-Infrared (NIR) spectral bands using the formula (NIR - Red) / (NIR + Red).

## Formula
$$
NDVI = (NIR - RED) / (NIR + RED)
$$

## Notes

- NDVI is an an example of normalized spectal mapping[@philpot2021].

- Rouse et al. (1974) publication is the standard citation for the introduction of NDVI in its common form[@Rouse1973]. 

- Tucker's work was crucial in establishing the relationship between NDVI and key vegetation parameters [@Tucker1979].
