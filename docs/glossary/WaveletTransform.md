# Wavelet Transform 

>> A wavelet transform is a mathematical technique used for analyzing signals by decomposing them into scaled and shifted versions of waveletsâ€”small, localized waves. It provides time-frequency (or spatial-frequency) information, enabling effective representation and processing of signals with varying resolution, widely applied in signal compression, noise reduction, feature detection, and image analysis.

Similar to forrier transform, but using localized 'wavelet' of a given shape instead of continual sine/cosine waves. 

## PyWavelets
You can use PyWavelets to play with wavelet transform directly in python/numpy.
