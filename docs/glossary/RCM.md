# RCM

## RADARSAT contellation Mission 

>> The RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) is a Canadian Earth observation satellite system operated by the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). It comprises three identical Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellites launched in 2019, designed to provide frequent, high-resolution radar imagery regardless of weather conditions or daylight. RCM is primarily used for maritime surveillance, disaster response, environmental monitoring, and resource management, significantly improving revisit times and data coverage compared to previous RADARSAT missions.
