>> PPP (Precise Point Positioning): An advanced Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) positioning technique enabling a single receiver to achieve high accuracy (typically centimeter to decimeter level) anywhere in the world. Unlike differential methods (like RTK) that require a connection to a nearby base station, PPP applies highly accurate, externally provided satellite orbit and clock correction data, combined with sophisticated modeling of GNSS error sources, directly to the single receiver's observations.
