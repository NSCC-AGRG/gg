# Velocity Grid

>> In geodesy, a gridded dataset representing the estimated horizontal and/or vertical velocity (typically in millimeters per year) of the Earth's crust across a region, modeling motion due to plate tectonics, post-glacial rebound, and other factors. Derived from long-term GNSS measurements (often from CORS networks), these grids are essential for accurately transforming coordinates measured at different times (epochs) to the official reference epoch of a dynamic geodetic datum, such as NAD83(CSRS) used in Canada, thereby maintaining positional consistency over time.
