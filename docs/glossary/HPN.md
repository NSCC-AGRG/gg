>> A network of geodetic control points (physical survey monuments) established with significantly higher accuracy than standard benchmarks, tied precisely to a specific geodetic datum (like NAD83). These networks provide a robust reference framework for surveying, mapping, and engineering projects within a region. In Canada, the primary national network of high-accuracy passive control points fulfilling this role is the Canadian Base Network (CBN), which is fundamental to the realization of the NAD83(CSRS) reference system.
