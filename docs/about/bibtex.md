# Bibtex

Bibtex is a simple ascii system for citing papers. You can generate Bibtex from DOI directly with tools such as:
[https://www.doi2bib.org/]()

Bibtex is used on this site to handle all the citations as it integrates well with mkdocs-bibtex: [https://github.com/shyamd/mkdocs-bibtex/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file]()

# Example:

```bibtex
@article{Bermudez2020,
  title = {Easy Epoxidation of Monoterpenes from Common Starting Materials},
  ISSN = {0103-5053},
